/*
 * A pointer of arbitrary type, that can have a different value for each thread that accesses it.
 * This object must NOT be of automatic storage (and you almost certainly don't want it to be anyway).
 *
 * examples:
 *
 * ThreadSpecificPtr<data> thread_local_data;
 *
 * void my_func() {
 *   if (!thread_local_data) thread_local_data = new data;
 *   thread_local_data->entry = 5;
 *   thread_local_data->updated = now();
 * }
 *
 * OR:
 * void my_func() {
 *   static ThreadSpecificPtr<int> recursion_count;
 *   if(!recursion_count) recursion_count = new int(0);
 *   if(++*recursion_count == 100) throw infinite_loop_exception();
 *
 *   ...
 * }
 * you may specify a custom cleanup function to be called on thread exit. By default the pointer is cast to the
 * right type and 'deleted' (so the above examples are fine and do not leak, and if thread_local_data had a
 * a destructor it would run).
 * The cleanup function will not be called for NULL pointers.
 * Under windows the cleanup function may run in a different thread to the one the TLS exists in (don't ask...)
 * Remember that the cleanup function may run during program exit (for the main process thread), so other global
 * variables may have been destroyed already.
 *
 * Thread local storage should only be used in the initial thread of a process or a thread 
 * created by the Thread class. Using it within any other type of thread _may_ work but will
 * probably leak memory.
 *
 * In windows TLS does not persist across DLL boundaries, so in the above example the thread_local_data in
 * one instance of MyDLL.dll will be different to the one in another instance of MyDLL.dll even in
 * the same process. This is just as would be the case with normal global and static variables.
