<br>
The wizard displays two progress bars to illustrate the status of the
upgrade. The top bar shows the fraction of the complete upgrade
procedure that has been completed. The lower bar shows the fraction of
the current operation that has been completed.<br>
<br>
Wait for the upgrade to complete.<br>
<br>
If you wish to stop the upgrade then click on the Abort button.
However, this should only be used as a last resort – it may leave the
BlueCore module in a non-operational state.<br>
