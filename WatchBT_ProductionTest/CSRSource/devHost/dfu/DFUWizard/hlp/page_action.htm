<br>
The wizard is usually used to upgrade the firmware of a BlueCore module
to a later version. However, to guard against the possibility of the
new version not operating correctly, the wizard also provides the
option to revert to an earlier version of software.<br>
<br>
Three options are offered:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Download a new version of the
firmware, saving a copy of the current version first.</span><br>
The wizard will save a copy of the existing firmware in the BlueCore
module, and then the new version will be downloaded. This is the normal
option to use.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Download a new version of the
firmware, without first saving a copy of the current version.</span><br>
The wizard will overwrite the existing firmware in the BlueCore module
without saving a copy first. This operation is irreversible; only use
it if the BlueCore module does not contain a version of firmware that
you may wish to restore.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Restore the previous version of the
firmware.</span><br>
The wizard will overwrite the existing firmware in the BlueCore module
with the version saved during the most recent upgrade. Use this option
if problems have been encountered after performing an upgrade.<br>
<br>
The wizard is not supplied with a saved copy of the firmware. Hence,
until an upgrade has been successfully completed, only the first option
will be selectable.<br>
<br>
Select the appropriate option and then click on the Next&nbsp;&gt;
button to progress to the next page.<br>
