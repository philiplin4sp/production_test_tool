<big style="font-weight: bold;">COM Port Selection</big><br>
<br>
If you selected the COM port (RS-232) option then the wizard will
display a list of all suitable COM ports that could be found.<br>
<br>
This page also allows the baud rate and protocol (BCSP or H4) to be
selected. Do not worry if these terms are unfamiliar to you; the wizard
can usually determine these settings itself, so leave the Automatically
detect communications settings option checked. Setting these options
incorrectly will not result in any damage, but it will prevent the
wizard from communicating with the device to be upgraded.<br>
<br>
Select the COM port that you wish to use and then click on the
Next&nbsp;&gt; button to progress to the next page.<br>
<br>
If the COM port that you wish to use is not displayed then ensure that
the computer is properly configured, and close any other programs that
may be using it. Then click on the &lt;&nbsp;Back button followed by
the Next&nbsp;&gt; button to update the list of ports.<br>
