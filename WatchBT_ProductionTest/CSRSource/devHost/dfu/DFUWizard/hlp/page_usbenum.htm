<br>
If you selected the Universal Serial Bus (USB) option then the wizard
will display a list of all suitable USB devices that can be found. Each
device will be listed with both its USB device number and, if
available, the Bluetooth device address (BD_ADDR). This page is skipped
if only a single suitable device could be found.<br>
<br>
Select the device that you wish to upgrade and then click on the
Next&nbsp;&gt; button to progress to the next page.<br>
<br>
If the device that you wish to upgrade is not displayed then ensure
that it is properly connected, and close any other programs that may be
using it. Then click on the &lt;&nbsp;Back button followed by the
Next&nbsp;&gt; button to update the list of devices.<br>
