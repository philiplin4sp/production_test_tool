If you have chosen to download a new version of firmware to the
BlueCore module then the wizard will request that you select the file
to download. New versions of firmware will usually be contained in
files with a .DFU extension (Device Firmware Upgrade file).<br>
<br>
Click on the Browse… button to open a file open dialog box, select the
required file and then click on the Next&nbsp;&gt; button to progress
to the next page.<br>
<br>
Be careful to check that the file is suitable for your particular
BlueCore module before starting an upgrade.<br>
