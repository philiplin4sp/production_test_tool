Installation.
=============

Use the install executable to install the whole of BlueSuite.  You may need 
to reboot your computer after the install has completed.  You need 
administator rights to install the software on NT, since a device driver 
for SPI is loaded.

  Manual Installation.
  ====================

	Windows NT / WIndows 2000.

	  1.	Copy the files to the destination directory : PSTool.exe, 
	  pshelp.dll, psspi.dll, psbccmd.dll, pshelp.dll, spi.dll.

	  2.	Run InstParSpi.bat.  You need administrative rights to do this, 
		since the installation process accesses the System area of the

Troubleshooting
===============

 - PSTool doesn't run at all (or briefly flickers on thes screen).  You 
	need to run "regsvr32 MSFLXGRD.OCX" to register the OCX .

 - Doesn't access the device.  This is usually because the device driver 
	isn't installed.

  o for Win9x copy the spivxd.vxd file into the directory you're running 
	the program from, or to the windows/system32 directory.

  o for WinNT run install.bat to copy and register the parspi.sys device 
	driver.  You need Administrative Rights to install the device 
	driver on an NT system.

 - Check your SPI cable is correctly connected, and make sure the stack 
	is running before you set the keys.  (Use the "Reset BC" and 
	"Reconnect" buttons.)
