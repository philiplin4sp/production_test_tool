DESCRIPTION
    This must be called before any of the other functions in this
    library.  It can be called multiple times.  It will optionally
    return a rough guess at the accuracy of the clock.  This guess
    is almost certainly an overestimate.

    This function is also possibly not thread safe (it is on all
    Posix versions and WinCE, but not windows).  It is possible to
    call any of the other functions from multiple threads at the
    same time, and they should all work, but if this function is
    called from one thread while another HiResClock function is
    running it might go horribly wrong (basically dont call this
    function more than you need to).
